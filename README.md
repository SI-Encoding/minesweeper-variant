# Minesweeper-variant

---
Developed an Android app with Java to play a game called minesweeper. Players try and find n mines which are randomly placed in cells on game board. Cells either contain a mine or a hint indicating number of mines in the cellâ€™s column and row. The goal is to find all the mines using the fewest hints as possible.
